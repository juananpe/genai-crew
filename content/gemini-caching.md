Context caching in Gemini allows you to store and pre-compute context, such as documents or even entire code repositories. This cached context can then be reused in subsequent requests, leading to significant cost savings â€“ potentially up to 75%.

For example, using Gemini 1.5 Pro, caching a full GitHub repository and then asking follow-up questions about it demonstrates this capability. Each subsequent request utilizing the same cache could cost substantially less ($0.31 vs. $1.25 per 1 million tokens, according to the tweet).

You can find a code example demonstrating this in the following notebook:

Here is an image illustrating the concept:

This concept is similar to OpenAI's prompt caching feature ([https://openai.com/index/api-prompt-caching/](https://openai.com/index/api-prompt-caching/)). With OpenAI, caching is reportedly automatic for prompts exceeding a certain token count (e.g., 1024 tokens), provided the context prefix remains unchanged in subsequent requests. If the prompt is inserted *before* the cached context, the caching mechanism might not be utilized.
